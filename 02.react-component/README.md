## React Functional Components 

**Also known as stateless components, functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They receive data as input (called "props" or properties) and return JSX (JavaScript XML) elements that represent the UI. Functional components are simple, easy to understand, and promote a functional programming style.**

## 
```
import React from 'react';

function Hello(){
  return <h1>Hello In Function Component </h1>
}
export default Hello
```

## React Class Components 

**Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class. They have a more advanced feature set and can manage state and lifecycle methods. Class components are useful when you need to handle complex UI logic or manage stateful data.**
