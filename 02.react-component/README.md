# React Function Component 

**Functional Components: Also known as stateless components, functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They receive data as input (called "props" or properties) and return JSX (JavaScript XML) elements that represent the UI. Functional components are simple, easy to understand, and promote a functional programming style.**
